## 📊 Data Source

* **Dataset:** US Domestic Flights Delay Data
* **Platform:** Kaggle
* **Scope:** Domestic flights within the United States
* **Data Includes:**

  * Flight status (Delayed / On-Time / Early)
  * Departure & arrival delays
  * Airlines
  * Airports (Origin)
  * Delay reasons (Weather, Carrier, NAS, Security, Late Aircraft)
  * Distance & time-based attributes

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Analyze flight delay patterns across airlines and airports
* Identify major causes of delays
* Compare on-time, delayed, and early flights
* Study the relationship between departure delay and arrival delay
* Provide decision-support insights using interactive visuals

---

## 📈 Dashboard Features

### 🔹 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* Total Flights
* Total Delayed Flights
* Total On-Time Flights
* Total Early Flights
* Average Delay Time (minutes)

---

### 🔹 Flight Status Analysis Over Time

* Monthly trend of:

  * Delayed Flights
  * On-Time Flights
  * Early Flights
* Helps identify seasonal patterns and peak delay periods

---

### 🔹 Airline Delay Composition

* Breakdown of delay reasons per airline:

  * Late Aircraft Delay
  * NAS Delay
  * Weather Delay
  * Security Delay
  * Carrier Delay
* Enables comparison of operational efficiency between airlines

---

### 🔹 Average Delay per Airline

* Ranking airlines by average delay minutes
* Highlights best and worst performers

---

### 🔹 Departure vs Arrival Delay

* Scatter plot showing correlation between departure delay and arrival delay
* Demonstrates how departure issues impact arrival performance

---

### 🔹 Flight Status Distribution

* Pie chart showing percentage of:

  * Delayed flights
  * On-time flights
  * Early flights

---

### 🔹 Top 10 Origin Airports by Delayed Flights

* Identifies airports with the highest number of delayed flights
* Useful for operational and infrastructure analysis

---

### 🔹 Delay by Distance Analysis

* Scatter plot analyzing average delay minutes against flight distance
* Reveals whether longer flights experience more delays

---

## 🎛 Interactivity

* **Time Slicer:** Filter data by time
* **Airline Slicer:** Filter by specific airline
* Dynamic visuals update instantly based on selections

---

## 🌙 Light Mode & Dark Mode

* Two complete dashboard themes implemented:

  * **Light Mode:** Clean and professional layout
  * **Dark / Night Mode:** Reduced eye strain, modern appearance

Both modes maintain identical insights and functionality.

---

## 📌 Key Insights

* Departure delay has a strong positive correlation with arrival delay
* Certain airlines consistently show higher average delays
* Weather and late aircraft are among the top delay causes
* Major hub airports experience higher delay volumes
* Distance alone does not significantly increase average delay

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Add predictive delay modeling
* Include weather severity data
* Drill-through pages for individual airlines and airports
* Deployment using Power BI Service or embedded analytics
