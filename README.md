✈️ Flight Delays Analysis and Visualization
🎯 Project Goal
This project analyzes and visualizes extensive flight delay data to identify the primary causes and patterns of delays, providing actionable insights for improving airline and airport operational performance.
📊 Data SourceThe analysis utilizes a massive Flight Delays Dataset sourced from [Kaggle]. The data includes detailed flight timings and categorized delay reasons (Carrier, Weather, NAS, Security, and Late Aircraft).
💡 Key Findings
Delay Volume: Approximately half (50%) of the 2 million total flights experienced delays.
Strong Correlation: There is a direct, strong correlation between departure delay and arrival delay (DepDelay $\propto$ ArrDelay).
Top Delay Hubs: ORD and ATL airports are the highest contributors to the total number of delayed flights.
Main Causes: The leading reasons for airline delays are Late Aircraft Delay and NAS Delay (National Air System).
Average Delay: Airlines are ranked by their average delay, with carriers like JetBlue and Mesa Airlines showing higher averages.
🛠️ Tools Used
Data: Kaggle Dataset.
Analysis & Visualization: Power BI ,Power Query , DAX, SQL .
🖼️ Dashboards
Interactive dashboards were built to cover the performance summary, breakdown of delay causes per carrier, and key airport performance metrics.
